  abstract = {The vorticity-stream function formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is used to study the effectiveness of the coupled strongly implicit multigrid (CSI-MG) method in the determination of high-Re fine-mesh flow solutions. The driven flow in a square cavity is used as the model problem. Solutions are obtained for configurations with Reynolds number as high as 10,000 and meshes consisting of as many as 257 × 257 points. For Re = 1000, the (129 × 129) grid solution required 1.5 minutes of CPU time on the AMDAHL 470 V/6 computer. Because of the appearance of one or more secondary vortices in the flow field, uniform mesh refinement was preferred to the use of one-dimensional grid-clustering coordinate transformations.}

  abstract = { An experimental study has been made of some aspects of the phenomena accompanying the collapse of liquid columns on to a rigid horizontal plane with air as the outer medium. The cases covered include the two-dimensional collapse of rectangular and semicircular sections, and the three-dimensional axial collapse of right circular cylinders. As the columns collapsed, the fluid spread across the horizontal plane, attaining a maximum velocity, which, in the two-dimensional cases, was proportional to the square root of the original height. It was not clear whether this proportionality would hold for the axial collapse of cylinders. If it did, then the factor of proportionality would be some 25 \% lower. In the two-dimensional cases the top of the residual column accelerated downwards to a maximum velocity proportional to the square root of the product of the original height and the original height to base ratio. The nature of the subsequent retardation indicated that the downward velocity probably approached zero asymptotically with time. }

The generalizationpermits identification with aspects of other point or node based discrete solution techniques which do not use a body–fixed grid, i.e. the “meshless methods”. Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified. Examples are used to demonstrate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected inMPM calculations.

It is shown to destroy the explicit solutionin one case, and seriouslydegrade it in another. Historydependent, inelasticconstitutivelaws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inaccurate stress states because of noisy input. The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions, and occurs due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries.

  abstract = {The aim of this research has been to conduct experimental measurements of the dam break impact on a vertical cylinder placed over a dry horizontal bed. The work aims to emphasize the effect of cylinder cross-section on the nature of impact as well as provide accurate and comprehensive data for the validation of computational fluid dynamics(CFD) codes. The experimental setup is based on a series of experiments conducted in the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM) between the years 2010 and 2017. The gate motion is thoroughly studied and a novel gate motion formula is proposed based on the recent experimental data. The effect of gate obstruction on the time of impact with the cylindrical obstacle is presented and correlated to the parameters of the proposed motion profile thus emphasizing its significance in the numerical modeling of dam break flow. The effect of the cross-section of the cylinder is studied by examining the pressure signal on the cylinder as well as the vertical wall downstream of the cylinder. The pressure on the wall is compared with the no-obstacle case to highlight its effect on the pressure of the downstream conditions. The square cylinder is found to experience fairly similar pressure impulse as the circular cylinder. However, the square cylinder seems to impede the flow momentum in the x-direction more than the circular case. The data-set presented in this article is provided as Supplementary Materials including gate motion measurement, pressure measurements, and high-resolution videos.}

The explicit algorithm is more effective as the number of particles n increases because the calculation time is O(n1.0) where n is the total number of the particles.

  abstract = {The method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is extended to model incompressible flows of low Reynolds number. For such flows, modification of the standard SPH formalism is required to minimize errors associated with the use of a quasi-incompressible equation of state. Treatment of viscosity, state equation, kernel interpolation, and boundary conditions are described. Simulations using the method show close agreement with series solutions for Couette and Poiseuille flows. Furthermore, comparison with finite element solutions for flow past a regular lattice of cylinders shows close agreement for the velocity and pressure fields. The SPH results exhibit small pressure fluctuations near curved boundaries. Further improvements to the boundary conditions may be possible which will reduce these errors. A similar method to that used here may permit the simulation of other flows at low Reynolds numbers using SPH. Further development will be needed for cases involving free surfaces or substantially different equations of state.;Extensions of the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are presented which allow the simulation of incompressible flows for low Reynolds numbers. Results suggest that the proposed equation of state, viscosity formulation, boundary conditions, and interpolation kernel result in a method which is stable and gives accurate estimates of velocity for Couette and Poiseuille flows. Peak pressures on solid boundaries are smoothed out at lower resolutions, but are achieved to within 5 percent for simulations involving over 10,000 particles. (AIAA);},

We demonstrate examples of our technique capturing realistic buckling, folding and coiling behavior.

By rephrasing the classical pressure projection step as a kinetic energy minimization, broadly similar to modern approaches to rigid body contact, we permit a robust coupling between fluid and arbitrary solid simulations that always gives a well-posed symmetric positive semi-definite linear system. We provide several examples of efficient fluid-solid interaction and rigid body coupling with sub-grid cell flow.

  abstract = {The numerical method used in this study is the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method, which is based on particles and their interactions. The particle number density is implicitly required to be constant to satisfy incompressibility. A semi-implicit algorithm is used for two-dimensional incompressible non-viscous flow analysis. The particles whose particle number densities are below a set point are considered as on the free surface. Grids are not necessary in any calculation steps. It is estimated that most of computation time is used in generation of the list of neighboring particles in a large problem. An algorithm to enhance the computation speed is proposed. The MPS method is applied to numerical simulation of breaking waves on slopes. Two types of breaking waves, plunging and spilling breakers, are observed in the calculation results. The breaker types are classified by using the minimum angular momentum at the wave front. The surf similarity parameter which separates the types agrees well with references. Breaking waves are also calculated with a passively moving float which is modelled by particles. Artificial friction due to the disturbed motion of particles causes errors in the flow velocity distribution which is shown in comparison with the theoretical solution of a cnoidal wave.

  abstract = {A new formulation is introduced for enforcing incompressibility in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The method uses a fractional step with the velocity field integrated forward in time without enforcing incompressibility. The resulting intermediate velocity field is then projected onto a divergence-free space by solving a pressure Poisson equation derived from an approximate pressure projection. Unlike earlier approaches used to simulate incompressible flows with SPH, the pressure is not a thermodynamic variable and the Courant condition is based only on fluid velocities and not on the speed of sound. Although larger time-steps can be used, the solution of the resulting elliptic pressure Poisson equation increases the total work per time-step. Efficiency comparisons show that the projection method has a significant potential to reduce the overall computational expense compared to weakly compressible SPH, particularly as the Reynolds number, Re, is increased. Simulations using this SPH projection technique show good agreement with finite-difference solutions for a vortex spin-down and Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The results, however, indicate that the use of an approximate projection to enforce incompressibility leads to error accumulation in the density field.}

abstract = {In this paper, some aspects of water impact and green water loading are considered by numerically investigating a dambreak problem and water entry problems. The numerical method is based on the Navier–Stokes equations that describe the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid. The equations are discretised on a fixed Cartesian grid using the finite volume method. Even though very small cut cells can appear when moving an object through the fixed grid, the method is stable. The free surface is displaced using the Volume-of-Fluid method together with a local height function, resulting in a strictly mass conserving method. The choice of boundary conditions at the free surface appears to be crucial for the accuracy and robustness of the method. For validation, results of a dambreak simulation are shown that can be compared with measurements. A box has been placed in the flow, as a model for a container on the deck of an offshore floater on which forces are calculated. The water entry problem has been investigated by dropping wedges with different dead-rise angles, a cylinder and a cone into calm water with a prescribed velocity. The resulting free surface dynamics, with the sideways jets, has been compared with photographs of experiments. Also a comparison of slamming coefficients with theory and experimental results has been made. Finally, a drop test with a free falling wedge has been simulated.}

After a review of state of the art wall treatment methods, an SPH method for modelling viscous and non-viscous flows in the presence of 3D complex wall boundaries is presented. New developments embedded in the proposed method include the addition of a Laplacian operator adapted to the adopted formalism, as well as a cutface process for calculating the particle/wall interactions on any type of geometry. Validations are proposed on a 2D Poiseuille flow, a flow around a 2D cylinder, a 3D hydrostatic tank, and a 3D dambreak. Comparisons are performed with results from the literature. Finally, an industrial automotive application is presented as illustration of the method ability to deal with arbitrarily complex geometries.}
